Promenade is a libary to simplify instrumenting Ruby applications with prometheus.

It is currently under development.

## Usage

Add promenade to your Gemfile:

```
gem "promenade"
```

### Built in instrumentation

Promenade includes some built in instrumentation that can be used by requiring it (for example in an initializer).

Currently there is just support for [ruby-kafka](https://github.com/zendesk/ruby-kafka), but I plan to support other things soon.

```
# Instrument the ruby-kafka libary
require "promenade/kafka"
```

### Instrumentation DSL

Promenade makes recording prometheus metrics from your own code a little simpler with a DSL of sorts.

`Promenade::Helper` includes some class macros for defining your own metrics, and a metric method you can use to record metrics.

#### Counter

A counter is a metric that exposes a sum or tally of things.

```ruby
require "promenade/helper"

class WidgetService
  include ::Promenade::Helper

  counter :widgets_created do
    doc "Records how many widgets are created"
  end

  def create
    # Widget creation code :)
    metric(:widgets_created).increment

    # You can also add extra labels as you set increment counters
    metric(:widgets_created).increment({ type: "guinness" })
  end

  def batch_create
    You can increment by more than 1 at a time if you need
    metric(:widgets_created).increment({ type: "guinness" }, 100)
  end
end
```

#### Gauge

A gauge is a metric that exposes an instantaneous value or some snapshot of a changing value.

```ruby
require "promenade/helper"

class Thermometer
  include ::Promenade::Helper

  gauge :room_temperature_celsius do
    doc "Records room temprature"
  end

  def take_mesurements
    metric(:room_temperature_celsius).set({ room: "lounge" }, 22.3)
    metric(:room_temperature_celsius).set({ room: "kitchen" }, 25.45)
    metric(:room_temperature_celsius).set({ room: "broom_cupboard" }, 15.37)
  end
end
```

#### Histogram

A histogram samples observations (usually things like request durations or
response sizes) and counts them in configurable buckets. It also provides a sum
of all observed values.

```ruby
require "promenade/helper"

class Calculator
  include ::Promenade::Helper

  histogram :calculator_time_taken do
    doc "Records how long it takes to do the adding"
    # promenade also has some bucket presets like :network and :memory for common usecases
    buckets [0.25, 0.5, 1, 2, 4]
  end

  def add_up
    timing = Benchmark.realtime do
      # Some time consuming addition
    end

    metric(:calculator_time_taken).observe({ operation: "addition"}, timing)
  end
end
```

#### Summary

Summary is similar to a histogram, but for when you just care about percentile values. Often useful for timings.

```ruby
require "promenade/helper"

class ApiClient
  include ::Promenade::Helper

  summary :api_client_http_timing do
    doc "record how long requests to the api are taking"
  end

  def get_users
    timing = Benchmark.realtime do
      # Makes a network call
    end

    metric(:api_client_http_timing).observe({ method: "get", path: "/api/v1/users" }, timing)
  end
end
```

### Exporter

Because promenade is based on prometheus-client you can add the `Prometheus::Client::Rack::Exporter` middleware to your rack middleware stack to expose metrics.

There is also a stand alone exporter that can be run with the `promenade` command.

This is ideal if you are worried about acidently exposing your metrics, are concerned about the performance impact prometheus scrapes might have on your application, or for applications without a webserver (like background processing jobs). It does mean that you have another process to manage on your server though ðŸ¤·.

The exporter runs by default on port `9394` and the metrics are avaible at the standard path of `/metrics`, the standalone exporter is congfigured to use gzip.

### Configuration

If you are using rails it should load a railtie and configure promenade.

If are not using rails you should call `Promenade.setup` after your environment has loaded.

In a typical development environment there should be nothing for you to do. Promenade stores its state files in `tmp/promenade` and will create that directory if it does not exist.

In a production environment you should try to store the state files on tmpfs for performance, you can configure the path that promenade will write to by setting the `PROMETHEUS_MULTIPROC_DIR` environment variable.

If you are running the standalone exporter, you may also set the `PORT` environment variable to bind to a port other than the default (`9394`).

## Development

After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies. Then, run `rake spec` to run the tests. You can also run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt that will allow you to experiment.

To install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake install`. To release a new version, update the version number in `version.rb`, and then run `bundle exec rake release`, which will create a git tag for the version, push git commits and tags, and push the `.gem` file to [rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org).
